The AsyncListDiffer can consume the values from a LiveData of List and present the data simply for an adapter. It computes differences in list contents via DiffUtil on a background thread as new List s are received. Use getCurrentList() to access the current List, and present its data objects.

## What are the Advantages of using COIL over Picasso, Glide, and UIL?

  Google has officially announced Kotlin as a preferred language for Android development and COIL is the library that is better optimized with Kotlin. So the optimization of this library with Kotlin makes it easier to load images from the server.
  
  COIL loads images very faster with the number of optimizations which includes memory, disk caching, reusing of bitmaps, and down spacing the image in memory which makes it faster in comparison with other image loading libraries.
  
  COIL adds ~2000 methods to your APK which are very less in number in comparison with Picasso, Glide, and UIL. This makes this library very lightweight and easy to use.
  
  COIL is the first image loading library which is completely introduced in Kotlin and it uses some modern libraries of Android such as Okio, OkHttp, and AndroidX lifecycles.
